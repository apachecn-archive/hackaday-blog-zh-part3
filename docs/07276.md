在 [Hackaday Superconference](https://supercon2017.eventbrite.com/?aff=hadcom1002) 的研讨会上，制作一些很酷的东西，学习新技能。上周我们在[宣布了所有你可以在 super co](https://hackaday.com/2017/09/27/all-the-speakers-plus-were-heating-it-up-a-day-early/)上找到的演讲，从今天开始你可以在其中一个研讨会上预定你的位置。

您必须拥有超级会议入场券才能购买研讨会入场券；如果你还没有，现在就买一个吧。您可以使用触觉和电子动画技术进行机械设计，将您的产品设计从原理图扩展到 PCB 和外壳，在多种选择的平台上进行嵌入式开发，让蜂窝塔为您服务，或者将过多的电压释放到一块木头上。

这些研讨会的空间有限，所以请确保在所有座位被占用之前报名。研讨会的基本价格是 10 美元(基本上是一个“游戏中的皮肤”价格，以鼓励那些注册的人出现)。任何高于这个基数的门票都是为了支付研讨会的材料费用。以下是我们的计划:

## 嵌入式编程与黑魔法和灯亮着

#### 彼得·埃斯登-坦普斯基

#### 周日下午

Embedded systems programming has earned a bad reputation of being difficult to master. Especially in the open-source world, most people associate it with cut and pasted code that is difficult to debug. The usual tools we have to debug embedded systems are a blinking LED and, if we are lucky, printf statements through a serial port. In this self guided workshop we will show you how easy it can be to have full insight into your microcontroller using fully open source tools that are on par with expensive proprietary closed-source solutions.

## 高电压的乐趣

#### 威尔·卡鲁阿纳

#### 周日早上

This workshop is about making Lichtenberg figures. A Lichtenberg figure is a piece of art though the multiplication of a few thousands of volts to burn wood. We will cover the science behind this art form as well as the safety and lastly we will be getting hands on experience in being able to using high voltage transformers to make these burnings into wood and make coasters you can take home.

## 设计电子纹理

#### 诺亚·费恩

#### 周日下午

Participants will learn the physics behind electrovibration, and then get to play/design for it using a new open-source board called WEFT. After the workshop, you’ll know how to deploy electrovibration in your projects, and understand the feeling of different waveforms.

## Eagle 和 Fusion 360 的端到端产品设计

#### 马特·伯格格伦

#### 周六上午

In this session, we’ll take you end to end, from building a new schematic, simulating a circuit using EAGLE’s built-in SPICE simulator, laying out a PCB, generating mfg files and include some tips & tricks for milling boards and making stencils. We’ll also take you thru the link between electronics and mechanics using Fusion360\. Alongside EAGLE we’ll build an enclosure and generate the mfg outputs for your mechanical design (CAM, 3D prints, etc). We’ll look at library management across electronics and mechanics and bidirectional synchronization between both of these domains. This is more than an intro, as Matt’s always good for some essential, oft-missed background and tips with EAGLE you might never have known otherwise.

## AVR MCU 轻松设计研讨会:传感器和 BLE 原型制作

#### 鲍伯·马丁，高级参谋工程师

#### 周日早上

This hands-on training session will walk you through how to develop an embedded sensor node prototype with Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. You will speed through configuration of the AVR microcontroller, sensor interface and communications interface setup by using Atmel Start, a graphical programming interface. This tool will generate libraries with simple APIs so you can spend time working on your solution instead of messing with registers or communication protocols.

## 使用 PocketBeagle 平台进行快速原型开发和 Linux 内核开发

#### 罗伯特·纳尔逊

#### 周六下午

The newly introduced PocketBeagle® is an ultra-tiny-yet-complete Linux-enabled, community-supported, open-source USB-key-fob computer. By leveraging the Octavo SIP, the PocketBeagle offers complete BeagleBoard functionality and includes 512MB DDR3 RAM, 1-GHz ARM Cortex-A8 CPU, 2x 200-MHz PRUs, ARM Cortex-M3, 3D accelerator, power/battery management and EEPROM. The board offers lots of GPIOs, on board peripherals and various expansion capabilities via multiple headers and the Mikroelektronika click board interface. During this course you will learn about pin configuration, how to create a Linux distribution, reconfiguring io on the fly and how to leverage expansion modules. Attendees will leave with their very own PocketBeagle and a couple other surprises as well.

## 下一个硬件项目的蜂窝连接

#### 本·斯特拉汉和克里斯·甘梅尔

#### 周六下午

Your project shouldn’t be constrained by the range of a WiFi signal. This workshop will show you how to connect to cellular towers via a serial link, get connected into the cloud and reliably start transmitting data. This workshop is suitable for people just getting started in the firmware ecosystem up through advanced firmware engineers. Advanced members of the workshop will have the opportunity to hack their conference badge to connect to cell towers. Sign up for this workshop to add another connection method to your hardware development toolbox.

## 具有激光切割触手机构的动画电子学导论

#### 约书亚·瓦斯奎兹

#### 周六上午

Animatronics are way cool, but the hacker community rarely ventures farther than a few hobby servos and “dem-blinkin’ LEDs.” In this workshop, I’ll get you cozy with tentacle mechanisms that you can build with just a laser cutter and a few hand tools. There are three big takeaways from this workshop. We’ll build up a two-stage controller reusable in other projects, muscle up our vocabulary of off-the-shelf parts for cable mechanisms, and discover a few laser-cut design techniques.

超级会议研讨会往往很快就销售一空。不要等着[拿到票](https://supercon2017.eventbrite.com/?aff=hadcom1002)。
