There are quick hacks, there are weekend projects and then there are years long journeys towards completion.  [Boris Vitazek]’s [grafofon](https://medium.com/boris-vitazek/sonifying-experimental-visual-scores-with-computer-vision-febf8c32d62d) falls into the latter category. His creation can best be described as electromechanical sequencer synthesizer with a multiplayer mode.The storage medium and interface for this sequencer is a thirteen-meter loop of paper that is mounted like a conveyor belt. Music is composed by drawing on the paper or placing objects on it. This is usually done by the audience and the fact that the marker isn’t erased make the result collaborative and incremental. These ‘scores’ are read by a camera and interpreted by software.This is a very vague description of this device, for a reason: the build went on over six years and both hard- and software went through several revisions in that time. It started as a trigger for MIDI notes and evolved from there.In his write up [Boris] explains the technical aspects of each iteration. He also tells the stories of the people he met while working on the grafofon and how they influenced the build. If this look into the art world reminds you of your local hackerspace, it is because these worlds aren’t that far apart.

We sure do like large musical machines like this [contraption](https://hackaday.com/2016/03/03/incredible-marble-music-machine/) by [Wintergatan] and [sequencers](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/13/hackaday-prize-entry-zappotron-super-sequencer/) made from random stuff also get our love.
