## 完整的谈话细节:

### 基调:百事通，一人之主

#### 瑞秋·王

#### 第一次会议

Rachel Wong has two passions. In her spare time she designs and builds wearable electronics with an eye to a time when high-tech fashion will be commonplace. When at work she is a stem cell researcher, focusing on projects like growing human eyes. The resulting tissue can be used to give the blind sight, and is now in clinical trials. Success in this line of research will help pave the way for breakthroughs in the development of other organ tissue. Rachel will discuss her work in both wearables and stem cell technology, taking the audience along for a glimpse into the future.

### 打造贝尔格莱德徽章

#### voja antonio 和 jaromir sukuba

#### 第二次会议

The custom electronic badge for the Hackaday Belgrade Conference was conceived, designed, and manufactured specifically for this event. Join Voja Antonic, who designed the hardware, and Jaromir Sukuba, who designed the firmware, as they discuss the process of producing unique electronics on tight timelines.

### 设计有意义硬件的 5 个案例

#### 凡妮莎·朱莉娅·卡彭特

#### 第三次会议

Five cases of hardware prototypes developed to explore what makes a meaningful experience are presented. From unusual sensors in jewellery, capacitive touch in Japanese craft, and a Bluetooth speaker / music creation interface, Vanessa extracts the qualities from each that move us towards creating experiences which help us to build identity and connect to ourselves and others. Vanessa asks engineers, hackers, makers, and inventors how can we create smart products with a focus on value over function?

### 用代码设计 PCB

#### 卡斯帕·伊曼纽尔

#### 第二次会议

Most engineers use EDA software to design circuits, but there are other ways. Kaspar has been exploring various tools and languages that allow you to use code rather than CAD software for your circuit design. If you have ever thought “I could easily solve this with a for-loop” when using KiCad or Eagle then this talk is for you. The overview and history speaks to programmers thinking about getting into designing circuits, anyone used to expressing their ideas with code, and those who enjoy learning different approaches to unique problems.

### Bitbanging 太 2017 了(树莓派和老友记的快速外设控制)

#### 马特·埃文斯

#### 第二次会议

There is a simple technique to output high-speed signals from a Raspberry Pi, with zero CPU overhead, in a slightly unexpected way. By re-purposing the Display Parallel Interface (DPI) video hardware, arbitrary control signals are output by writing patterns to the framebuffer. This is faster and lower-overhead than ‘bit banging’ IO ports in software. Matt will cover the concepts, give an example (and possibly demo) of driving a 64×64 RGB LED array, and discuss other potential uses.

### 软式飞艇——像无人驾驶飞机，但不会把你的头拿掉

#### 索菲·克拉维茨

#### 第一次会议

A blimp is a nonrigid airship used for advertising, scientific research… and fun! Sophi developed a mini-blimp to fly around the house, through hula-hoops, and to go to death battle with other mini-blimps. This mini-blimp features custom hardware bringing together motor controls, a power system, and an ESP8266 which talks to a giant red joystick. Since a mini-blimp is essentially some tiny fan motors propelling an oddly shaped balloon, it seemed like this would be an easy task. While developing her own mini-blimp, Sophi learned that making something that flies has a bunch of gotchas which she’ll detail during her presentation.

### 在家制作你的声学漂浮器

#### 阿西尔·马索

#### 第一次会议

Acoustic Levitation uses the energy of sound to hold particles in mid-air without any physical contact. Acoustic levitation is not suited for supporting large mass like humans but, quite useful for manipulating small particles including liquids and powders. Levitated droplets of reagents are already being used in lab work during complex chemical reaction. Asier Marzo plans a live demonstrations to go along with this talk covering how to build an acoustic levitator with regular off-the-shelf components.

### 无人机辅助物联网传感器网络部署和 LoraWAN 覆盖地图绘制

#### 卢卡穆斯塔法

#### 第一次会议

Studying wildlife in remote areas to implement informed conservation strategies requires a simple and time-efficient method to build sensor networks covering vast inaccessible areas. As founder of the Institue IRNAS, Luka has developed animal trackers, static sensors, and drone automated signal coverage mapping methods across water and over tree-tops. In his talk he will present solutions and challenges encountered in projects involving Green Sea Turtles monitoring in Africa, and Arboreal monitoring in Peru.

### 黑客时代的现状

#### 迈克·普莱司

#### 第三次会议

Hackaday Editor in Chief Mike Szczys takes the stage to discuss the past, present, and future of this amazing community. From Hackaday’s editorial voice to its celebration of new tricks and techniques, from weekly Hack Chats to monthly meetups, and from a global engineering initiative to a scholarly journal, Hackaday holds high the pursuit of knowledge and the free and open sharing of information and ideas. Mike looks at the common threads that bring us all together and make Hackaday the greatest engineering community on earth.

### 黑客焊接机器人与开源硬件笔记本电脑 TERES-I

#### 茨韦坦·乌苏诺夫

#### 第三次会议

What happens when industrial automation robots come with terrible UI and programming? Tsvetan takes on the challenge of improving a robot used for soldering plated through-hole (PTH) components. Improvement efforts included more sophisticated software, adding cameras to provide feedback, and hacking the communications protocol. Tsvetan will show just how good this automated soldering machine can become with the right alterations.

### 不用微处理器建立 TTL 微型计算机

#### 马塞尔·范·克尔温克

#### 第二次会议

Marcel designed and built a small 8-bits homebrew computer using a few dozen 1970s TTL chips, an oscillator, some RAM, an EPROM, and a handful of passives. The computer has similar capabilities as the microcomputers of the early 1980s and the first PCs, except that it has no brain; it is entirely driven by simple TTL logic, without the need for a microprocessor, a video card, or a sound chip. Marcel shares his experience including what went right and what went wrong along the way.

### 逻辑噪音:从数字混乱中破解音乐

#### 埃利奥特·威廉姆斯

#### 第二次会议

Of course you could just take a beautiful-sounding instrument and simply play the right notes. But that’s taking the easy way out. Instead, this talk is about using basic logic ICs to build something musical or at least interestingly noisy, a tradition that’s as old as the 4000-series chips themselves. Elliot will demo a big handful of his favorite algorithms and circuits for composing in solder, and if all goes well, “music” will emerge.

### 最早的电脑控制互动机器人雕塑

#### Aleksandar Zivanovic

#### 第三次会议

Aleksandar explores some of the earliest truly interactive robotic sculptures, developed by Edward Ihnatowicz. His first sculpture, Sound Activated Mobile, used analogue electronics to turn to face the direction of sound and was exhibited at the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition in 1968\. His largest work, The Senster, was a hydraulically actuated, computer-controlled robot that turned to face visitors to the Evoluon in the Netherlands in 1970\. Join in on a journey to the dawn of robotics as art.

## 完成研讨会详情:

### 在 PCB 中创造艺术

#### 布莱恩·班考夫

#### 第一次会议

This workshop will guide attendees through the process of creating art in PCBs. Topics covered will be the layer stackup of the modern PCB (copper, fiberglass, soldermask, and silkscreen), the current state-of-the-art using Chinese board houses, and how to implement graphics in PCB art using KiCad.

### 交互式诗歌手套

#### Lavoslava Benčić

#### 第二次会议

In this e-textile workshop, participants will create a unique interactive wearable that generates sounds of various frequencies and responds to the touch (pressure). This includes learning about electronic elements and circuits with emphasis on the capacitive, conductive, and resistive properties of fabrics and yarns.

### FPGA 开发 101

#### 米奥德拉·米拉诺维奇

#### 第三次会议

This workshop will show the capabilities of FPGA devices, providing an introduction into FPGA tools used and the Verilog hardware description language. We will go through prepared examples and show the differences in approach when doing design for FPGA and MCU.

这将是一个令人惊奇的周末。我们期待在贝尔格莱德的[hack aday](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hackaday-belgrade-2018-tickets-42286732756?aff=hadcom0430)见到您！
