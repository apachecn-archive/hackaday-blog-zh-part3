# 3D 打印机外壳令人耳目一新

There’s a lot going on in the 3D printing world. Huge printing beds, unique materials like concrete, and more accessible, inexpensive printers for us regular folk. The only thing that’s often overlooked with these smaller printers is the ruckus that they can make. The sounds of all those motors can get tiresome after a while, which was likely the inspiration for [Fabien]’s home [3D printer workstation](https://www.carnetdumaker.net/articles/fabrication-dun-meuble-pour-imprimante-3d-partie-1/). ([Google Translate from French](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carnetdumaker.net%2Farticles%2Ffabrication-dun-meuble-pour-imprimante-3d-partie-1%2F))After acquiring a new printer, [Fabien] needed a place to put it and created his own piece of furniture for it. The stand is made out of spruce and is lined with insulation. He uses a combination of cork, foam, and recycled rubber tile to help with heat, sound, and vibration respectively. Don’t worry, though, he did install a [ventilation system](https://twitter.com/skywodd/status/737341199296630784) for the fumes! After the printer housing is squared away, he place a webcam inside so that the user can monitor the print without disturbing it. Everything, including the current print, is managed with a computer on the top of the cabinet.Having a good workspace is just as important as having a quality tool, and [Fabien] has certainly accomplished that for his new 3D printer. There have been a lot of good workspace builds over the years, too, including [electronics labs in a portable box](https://hackaday.com/2014/03/09/another-awesome-electronics-lab-in-a-box/) and this [masterpiece workbench](http://hackaday.com/2016/07/04/feel-extreme-workbench-envy-after-seeing-the-tempel/). If you’ve ever experienced the frustration of working in an area that wasn’t designed for the task at hand, you’ll easily be able to appreciate any of these custom solutions.
